        <h2>Top Review</h2>
        <p>This is the perfect chocolate chip cookie!! Crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside!! For added flavor I also add l cup of white chocolate chips (try the brand that Aldi's carries...wonderful....better then Nestles!!) Some have stated that their cookies were too cakelike, this is caused by the addition of too much flour. To help prevent this, spoon flour into measuring cup, leveling off with knife, rather then dipping cup into flour. Roll dough into walnut size balls. Be careful not to overbake, I decrease my oven temperature to 325 and bake for l0 minutes. I have tried dozens of chocolate chip cookie recipes over the years, this one is far superior to any of them!! Makes 4 dozen. Thanks for sharing.</p>
